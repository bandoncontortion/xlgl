# XLGL - There will be no further work done on this project.

The Xfian Lightweight OpenGL Library

Building
  1. Use `make list` for a list of targets you can build for
  2. Type `make [target]` so for Linux with X11 we would do `make linux_x11`

If you want to make all of the libraries do just `make`

Currently the windows makefiles are built to be run on Linux with a toolchain. I will add a Windows MinGW makefile later
